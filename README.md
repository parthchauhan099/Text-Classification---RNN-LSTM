# Text-Classification---RNN-LSTM
This repository showcases the implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for text classification tasks. It includes the full pipeline, from preprocessing raw text data to building and evaluating deep learning models, highlighting the effectiveness of sequential models in handling textual data.

Features:

    * Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, and sequence preparation for model input.
    * Modeling: Implementation of both RNN and LSTM architectures, tailored for text classification.
    * Comparison: Performance evaluation and comparison of RNN and LSTM models using metrics and visualizations.
    * Evaluation: Detailed insights into accuracy, loss, and other key metrics for both models.
    * Visualizations: Graphical analysis of model training and evaluation results.

Dependencies:
    Python libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and others as specified in the requirements file.
